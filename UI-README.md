# 🏦 Banking System UI - CORS Solutions

## 🚨 CORS Error Fix

If you're getting CORS errors when using the HTML UI, here are **3 solutions**:

---

## ✅ Solution 1: Use Spring Boot to Serve UI (RECOMMENDED)

### Steps:
1. **Start your Spring Boot application:**
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

2. **Open your browser and go to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```
   or
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/index.html
   ```

### ✅ This is the BEST solution because:
- ✅ No CORS issues
- ✅ UI and API served from same domain
- ✅ Production-ready setup
- ✅ No additional servers needed

---

## ✅ Solution 2: Use CORS Configuration (Alternative)

### What I did:
- ✅ Created `WebConfig.java` with CORS configuration
- ✅ Allows requests from `file://` protocol
- ✅ Supports all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

### Steps:
1. **Start your Spring Boot application:**
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

2. **Open the HTML file directly in browser:**
   - Open `src/main/resources/static/index.html` in your browser
   - Or double-click the file in your file explorer

### ✅ CORS Configuration Details:
```java
@Configuration
public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {
    @Override
    public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
        registry.addMapping("/api/v1/accounts/**")
                .allowedOrigins("http://localhost:8080", "http://127.0.0.1:8080", "file://")
                .allowedMethods("GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS")
                .allowedHeaders("*")
                .allowCredentials(false);
    }
}
```

## 🎯 Which Solution Should You Choose?

| Solution | Best For | Complexity | CORS Issues |
|----------|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Spring Boot** | Production | ⭐⭐⭐ | ❌ None |
| **CORS Config** | Development | ⭐⭐ | ✅ Fixed |

### My Recommendation: **Use Spring Boot Solution**

The Spring Boot solution is now the **only recommended approach** since it serves both the UI and API from the same server, eliminating all CORS issues and simplifying the architecture.

## 🧪 Testing the UI

Once you have the UI working, you can:

### ✅ Create Account:
1. Fill in the form fields
2. Click "Create Account"
3. See success message with account details

### ✅ Update Account:
1. Enter account number in "Account Number to Update"
2. Click "Load Account"
3. Modify the fields
4. Click "Update Account"

### ✅ Search Accounts:
1. Enter search term (name or account number)
2. Click "Search"
3. View matching accounts

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If you still get CORS errors:
1. **Check browser console** for specific error messages
2. **Verify Spring Boot is running** on port 8080
3. **Try different browser** (some have stricter CORS policies)
4. **Check firewall/antivirus** blocking requests

### If UI doesn't load:
1. **Verify file paths** are correct
2. **Check browser developer tools** for 404 errors
3. **Try refreshing** the page
